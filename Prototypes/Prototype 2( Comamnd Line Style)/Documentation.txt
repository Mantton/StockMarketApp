PROJECT CODE : REOX001

PROJECT NAME : STOCK MARKET APP

CREATED BY : SHEDRACH UZOUKWU




OVERVIEW;

This is my first project sO I wanted to apply my basic knowledge of python into  real world stuff.
I decided that I would develop a stock market app as I have been really interested in investing in the stock markets.
This project should help me understand how to import and use external Libraries and apply them into a functional code



RESOURCES :

Yahoo finance API
GUI Library PyQt or Tkinter

DAY 1 OUTLINES :

GET YAHOO API WORKING WITHING SCRIPT, TEST AND SEE HOW IT CAN BE APPLIED IN A LARGER SCALE

CHOOSE THE GUI LIBRARY AS IT WOULD BE STUCK TO.



DAY 1 UPDATES :

Yahoo finance seems to not be working.

changed stock library to yahoo_fin, works fine with a a lot of delay.

Takes approximately 4 secs to retrieve the data

Looking for different library, undable to retrieve etra info such as last close etc

Gonna leave the stocks stuff with yahoo_fin for now but will prolly switch

moving on to finding the bst GUI library

currently working with TKinter

understood the basics of TKinter so gonna apply it with the yahoo-fin stuff to simply return
the current price of a stock

# program complete and working;

yahoo_fin only reads NASDAQ  stocks
have to put a try and except block to catch that vallue error

unfortunately the value error is not the only errror exiting the get_stock_price function so
i have to leave an open except method

Returning to get a better Stock Market API, will need extar info to make the app run better

These are all prototypes. After the final prototype i will be implementing the user exterience application as part
of the main program


Trying to redo the program using PyQt as I was able to find a design editor faster than on tkinter, plu sits being used
alot ore often now so might be worth learning it so i dont know .


day 2

working on cammand line version of app


DAY 2 OVERVIEW

really good day : completed alot of the functions, got stuck at the Datasheet saing part

DAY 3:
-HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT TOOK FOREVER

-FINALLY GOT THE DATASHEET TO FUCKING WORK

-ran into a huge bug that causes the orders not to save until the program has been exited.

-done  for the day,
-will upload it to github now
