PROJECT CODE : REOX001

PROJECT NAME : STOCK MARKET APP

CREATED BY : SHEDRACH UZOUKWU




OVERVIEW;

This is my first project sO I wanted to apply my basic knowledge of python into  real world stuff.
I decided that I would develop a stock market app as I have been really interested in investing in the stock markets.
This project should help me understand how to import and use external Libraries and apply them into a functional code



RESOURCES :

Yahoo finance API
GUI Library PyQt or Tkinter

DAY 1 OUTLINES :

GET YAHOO API WORKING WITHING SCRIPT, TEST AND SEE HOW IT CAN BE APPLIED IN A LARGER SCALE

CHOOSE THE GUI LIBRARY AS IT WOULD BE STUCK TO.



DAY 1 UPDATES :

Yahoo finance seems to not be working.

changed stock library to yahoo_fin, works fine with a a lot of delay.

Takes approximately 4 secs to retrieve the data

Looking for different library, undable to retrieve etra info such as last close etc

Gonna leave the stocks stuff with yahoo_fin for now but will prolly switch

moving on to finding the bst GUI library

currently working with TKinter

understood the basics of TKinter so gonna apply it with the yahoo-fin stuff to simply return
the current price of a stock

# program complete and working;

yahoo_fin only reads NASDAQ  stocks
have to put a try and except block to catch that vallue error

unfortunately the value error is not the only errror exiting the get_stock_price function so
i have to leave an open except method

Returning to get a better Stock Market API, will need extar info to make the app run better

These are all prototypes. After the final prototype i will be implementing the user exterience application as part
of the main program


Trying to redo the program using PyQt as I was able to find a design editor faster than on tkinter, plu sits being used
alot ore often now so might be worth learning it so i dont know .


day 2

working on cammand line version of app


DAY 2 OVERVIEW

really good day : completed alot of the functions, got stuck at the Datasheet saing part

DAY 3:
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THAT TOOK FOREVER

FINALLY GOT THE DATASHEET TO FUCKING WORK

ran into a huge bug that causes the orders not to save until the program has been exited.

done  for the day,
will upload it to git hub now


TASKS FOR DAY 4 :

-CREATE SELL FUNCTION
-ADD COLOR CODING TO EXCEL WORKSHEET - DROPPED
-CREATE 'show.total_invested'
-CREATE OUTLINE FOR GUI APP


DAY 4!

OKI lets start the debug process

-OKI DEBUG COMPLETE, PROGRAM WORKINIG FINE, THAT BUG IS STILL THERE

tasks to start off:

show.total_invested function - DONE

SELL FUNCTION :

HOW IT SHOULD WORK :

since i do not need to get the price i bought it at i can wrk the function solely on the datasheet.xlsx

itll just get the current price of a stock and* by the amount requested to be sold remove that amount from the stock amount cell

lets go


sell function complete, just one major bug:
Unable to get worksheet to save to file thus doing evrything but updating the datasheet

HOLY FUCKING SHIT, HOW DOES EVERYTHING WORK ASIDE FROM THIS LAST PEICE OF CODE

THIS PROJDCT WOULD  99.9% FUCKING COMPLETE IF THIS BLOODY DATASHEET WOULD JUST FUCKING SAVE


LOL found the issue with the code:

- Sved file as data.xlxs instead of xlsx
- When updating the portfolio it takes into account the total stock from the orders worksheet makiing the func irelvant
as it is overwritten on each update.
so I beleive the fix is to link the shares sold to the ordeers fie then get the total



FINALLY

got it working

the prject is complete


BUGS AS WE END :

-Have to exit the program to sve the changes to orders.xlsx
-Code cannot differentiate between taking out money from investment and losing money in a stock drop
-May cause excel to behave funky or slow
- Cannot differntiate between a wrong symbol and no network connection




well that i where i leave it to rest, GG
